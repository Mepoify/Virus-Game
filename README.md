The Virus Game is a game, (currently a idea in progress) inspired by "There Is No Game" and "Kinitopet." As players progress through The Virus Game, their primary objective is to eliminate the sentient virus that has infiltrated their system. The virus manifests fake error messages, glitches, and corrupted files, creating challenges that players must navigate. To succeed, players will need to solve puzzles, riddles, decode hidden messages, and use problem-solving skills to reverse the damage caused by the virus and get rid of it. 

The game supposed to auto-run from a USB input, but for security reasons, it is blocked by Windows. To provide a similar experience, it will initially be launched from a website or app that detects when the specific USB containing the run code is inserted, triggering the program and launching the game.
